## AURA (ADHD Understanding & Recognition Algorithm): Multimodal Machine Learning for Accurate ADHD Diagnosis Across Sexes.

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is severely underdiagnosed in women and young girls, with
50-75% cases are estimated to be missed leading to delayed treatment, worsened mental health outcomes,
educational and occupational disadvantages, and reinforces systemic biases in healthcare. A key contributor
to this disparity is that current diagnostic standards inadequately account for behavioral differences between
females and males. Despite increasing awareness of these behavioral differences, there remains an
absence of sex-specific diagnostic frameworks or predictive models for ADHD. We have the opportunity to
address this gap using data and resources made available through the WiDS Datathon, providing access to
a rich dataset that includes behavioral and emotional assessments, cognitive testing, resting state functional
MRI (rs-fMRI) connectome data, parenting information, socio-demographic information, and diagnostic
targets (sex and ADHD diagnosis). Its multimodal structure and clean organization enable a systematic study
of sex-based differences in ADHD presentation. Moreover, the harmonized preprocessing and integration of
fMRI connectomes and behavioral modalities lower the technical barrier to advanced modeling, facilitating
robust predictive analysis. Our team combines technical expertise, domain knowledge, and a strong
commitment to equity in healthcare, supported by access to high-performance computing resources at
Stanford. The WiDS Datathon presents a timely platform to investigate sex-aware ADHD prediction models
and diagnostic refinement. Therefore, we outline a plan to: (1) identify measurable sex-based differences in
ADHD diagnosis criteria, (2) construct sex-specific predictive models for ADHD diagnosis, and (3) engage
stakeholders to inform development of sex-informed ADHD diagnostic models. Closing the gender gap in
ADHD diagnosis will help reduce misdiagnosis, improve mental health outcomes, and enhance long-term
wellbeing and quality of life for historically overlooked populations.
